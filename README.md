# Weka3
Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.

Found only on the islands of New Zealand, the Weka is a flightless bird with an inquisitive nature. The name is pronounced like this, and the bird sounds like this.

Weka is open source software issued under the GNU General Public License.

# Learn ML algorithms
I built this repository to learn the source code of machine learning algorithms, and there will be some Chinese code comment in .java files.
